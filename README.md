__Customizable Weapons List__-  You can now customize what weapons you are given in Gungame and Sharpshooter!

__Mutators__ - There are 16 ways to mutate your zombies experience! A homage to the skulls in Halo, mutators allow you to turn on various fun events for your session such as Zombie Birthday Party, Fireworks, and more. Only 5 mutators are unlocked for the beta so that the surprise isn't spoiled. You will need to unlock the mutators for each map by completing certain UGX Mod challenges (not available in beta).

__Pandora's Box__ - A complete re-imaging of the class Mystery Box designed to look like a coffin! You can now let other players buy your weapon from the box at a discounted price!

__Weapon Boxes__ - No more wall chalks! We've designed a new way to buy your guns! Mappers who want to still use traditional weapon chalks can still do so.

__Invite Friends without being Host__ - Now you can invite any of your friends to the current game lobby without being the host!

__Respawn to Teammates__ - Annoyed with being put back at spawn when you die? Now you will respawn close to your teammates!

__Boss Zombie__ - The Boss Zombie from UGX Mod v1.0.3 makes a return in v1.1! Now he looks like Brutus from Mob of the Dead but he still uses our special custom attacks such as screaming and barfing! You will only find him in Arcademode.

__Persistent User Settings__ - Tired of setting your FOV (and ADS FOV) every time you load the game? Annoyed when a map has the console disabled and you can't change your FOV? Looking for a way to turn off Hitmarkers? You will find all of these settings in the UGX Mod Settings sectinon of the Options Menu in any UGX Mod v1.1-enabled map. The settings you change here will be SAVED to your profile and loaded into any other UGX Mod v1.1-enabled map you play!

__Togglable Hitmarkers__ - UGX Mod v1.1 has hitmakers - if you don't like to hear the sound, you can mute them. If you don't want to see them at all, you can disable them. Your setting will be saved for all v1.1 maps.

__Full Xbox 360/Gamepad Support__ - Are you a console gamer who prefers to play customs with a controller? Well now you can have an even better experience - You can navigate all menus in UGX Mod with your controller's DPad! You will automatically be switched to mouse control when visiting any unsupported menus or menus which would be inefficient to navigate with a controller. Ingame, the DPad will be used to display your current equipment instead of a row on the bottom of the screen.

__Solo Scoreboard__ - You can now view your score in Singleplayer by holding the TAB key or Back button (controllers).

__Weapon Bobbing__ - Your weapons will now bob left and right as you walk, mimicking the feel of BO1/2.

__Footstep Noises__ - The footstep noises were missing in UGX Mod v1.0.3, now they have been added.

__Remastered BO2 Perk Icons__ - Some of the icons in BO2 were lower resolution than the rest for some reason - I recreated those by hand in Photoshop to match the quality of the other perk icons in the mod.

## NEW GAME MODES
Now there are more ways to enjoy World at War's zombie mode! Expanding on the classic zombie gameplay, we've included 5 separate game modes each offering a unique experience:

__Gun Game__: This was a favourite from UGX Christmas, and it's been tweaked and improved to be even better than before. Compete with your friends to get enough points, so you can reach the highest gun in the cycle before they can beat you to it.

__Sharpshooter__: An endless cycle of random weapons is thrust upon the players, forcing you to fight off the zombie horde with whatever you're given! This offers a fun twist on the classic zombie mode.

__Bounty Hunter__: A special zombie is marked in the game, and you must compete with your friends to be the first one to kill him, in order to gain a mega points bonus!

__Arcade Mode__: Our specially tweaked variant of traditional zombie gameplay, Arcade Mode includes 8+ new powerups and a special boss zombie round.

__Classic__: Un-altered classic Call of Duty zombies, but with the UGX Mod's epic arsenal of weaponry at your disposal.

Timed gameplay can optionally be activated on all five game modes, and on certain UGX official map releases there will be an option to enable objective gameplay too; this will be specific and unique to individual maps.

## RANKING SYSTEM
The UGX mod tracks stats and points gained in matches, allowing you to rank-up - this will unlock beneficial abilities or other unlockables to make your game experience persistently fun!
In addition to this there is a unique Challenges system with a variety of special prizes awarded to players who manage to master a weapon, or perform an awesome feat. This includes all-new challenges which we've created ourselves!

## 70+ NEW WEAPONS
Fight off hordes of zombies with a brand new arsenal of epic weapons, including totally custom-built guns from UGX!
